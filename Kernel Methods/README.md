# Kernel Methods

This section of the repository focuses on **Kernel Methods**, a powerful class of algorithms widely used in the field of machine learning. Kernel Methods are particularly effective for non-linear problems, transforming data into higher-dimensional spaces where linear techniques can be applied.

## Overview

Kernel Methods are a set of techniques that leverage the "kernel trick" to implicitly map data into a higher-dimensional space without explicitly performing the transformation. These methods are the backbone of algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Processes.

### Why Kernel Methods?

- **Flexibility**: Handle non-linear problems effectively.
- **Robustness**: Can be applied to a wide variety of data types.
- **Mathematical Elegance**: Utilize inner product spaces for computations without explicit transformations.
