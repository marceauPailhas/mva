# Assignment 3 - Machine Learning for Time Series

This folder contains the third assignment for the Machine Learning for Time Series course at MVA 2022-2023.

## Overview

This assignment focuses on advanced topics in time series analysis:

- Change point detection in time series
- Graph signal processing for time series data
- Applications of these techniques to real-world problems

## Contents

- `Assignment 3.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the assignment solutions
- `05_ChangePointDetection.ipynb`: Notebook focusing on change point detection methods
- `06_GraphSignal.ipynb`: Notebook focusing on graph signal processing techniques
- `pw_normal.csv`, `signal_1.csv`, `signal_2.csv`: Data files used in the analysis
- `R_1.png`, `R_3.png`, `R_5.png`: Visualization results
- `report.tex`, `shortcuts.sty`, `theme.sty`: LaTeX files for report generation

## Change Point Detection

The change point detection section explores methods for identifying structural changes in time series data, including:

- Statistical approaches to change point detection
- Bayesian methods
- Online vs. offline detection algorithms
- Performance evaluation of different methods

## Graph Signal Processing

The graph signal processing section covers:

- Representation of time series as signals on graphs
- Graph Fourier transforms
- Filtering in the graph spectral domain
- Applications to multivariate time series

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files)
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, networkx, etc.)
3. Run the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis and results

## Report

The LaTeX files can be compiled to generate a comprehensive report of the findings and methodologies used in this assignment.
