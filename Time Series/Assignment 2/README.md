# Assignment 2 - Machine Learning for Time Series

This folder contains the second assignment for the Machine Learning for Time Series course at MVA 2022-2023.

## Overview

This assignment explores advanced time series modeling techniques, building upon the foundational concepts covered in Assignment 1. The focus is on:

- Time series forecasting methods
- Model selection and evaluation
- Feature engineering for time series data
- Handling non-stationarity and seasonality

## Contents

- `Assignment 2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the assignment solutions
- `images/`: Directory containing figures and plots generated during the analysis
- `rapport/`: Directory containing the written report and supporting files

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Assignment 2.ipynb`
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, statsmodels, etc.)
3. Run the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis and results

## Key Techniques

The assignment implements and evaluates several time series modeling approaches:

- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models
- Exponential smoothing methods
- Machine learning-based forecasting
- Evaluation metrics specific to time series forecasting

## Report

The `rapport/` directory contains a detailed report discussing the methodology, implementation details, and findings from the assignment. The report includes:

- Theoretical background
- Implementation details
- Results and visualizations
- Discussion and conclusions
