# Time Series Analysis - MVA 2022-2023

This repository contains assignments and projects for the Machine Learning for Time Series (ML for TS) course at MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) 2022-2023.

## Repository Structure

- **Assignment 1**: Introduction to time series analysis, focusing on autocovariance estimation and Barlett's test
- **Assignment 2**: Advanced time series modeling techniques
- **Assignment 3**: Change point detection and graph signal processing for time series
- **Mini Project**: Audio source separation project using various techniques (IVA, ICA, MNMF, ILRMA)
  

## Course Overview

This course covers fundamental and advanced concepts in time series analysis, including:

- Statistical properties of time series
- Estimation techniques
