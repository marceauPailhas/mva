# Assignment 1 - Machine Learning for Time Series

This folder contains the first assignment for the Machine Learning for Time Series course at MVA 2022-2023.

## Overview

This assignment focuses on fundamental concepts in time series analysis:

- Autocovariance estimation for time series data
- Barlett's test for stationarity
- Statistical properties of time series estimators

## Contents

- `Assignment 1 - ML for TS (MVA 22-23).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the assignment solutions
- `Assignment 1 - ML for TS (MVA 22-23).pdf`: PDF version of the assignment
- `autocovariance_N=200.png`, `autocovariance_N=500.png`, `autocovariance_N=1000.png`: Visualizations of autocovariance estimates for different sample sizes
- `Barlettestimate_N=200.png`, `Barlettestimate_N=500.png`, `Barlettestimate_N=1000.png`: Visualizations of Barlett's test results for different sample sizes
- `main.tex`, `shortcuts.sty`, `theme.sty`: LaTeX files for report generation

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Assignment 1 - ML for TS (MVA 22-23).ipynb`
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)
3. Run the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis and results

## Key Findings

The assignment demonstrates how sample size affects the accuracy of autocovariance estimation and the power of Barlett's test for detecting non-stationarity in time series data.
