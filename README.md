## Featured Projects

### [Flappy Bird - Deep Reinforcement Learning](Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/final%20project/)

Developed and implemented various reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent to play Flappy Bird. Compared different approaches including heuristic rules, Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN), and hybrid methods combining rules with learning-based approaches.

**Key techniques**: Deep Q-Learning, LSTM networks, heuristic rules, hyperparameter optimization

### [Graph Classification with Kernel Methods](Kaggle_Challenge_Marceau_PAILHAS_Antoine_GORCEIX/)

A machine learning project focused on classifying molecules based on their graph structure. Implemented custom kernel methods to capture the structural similarities between molecular graphs, achieving a 0.75 ROC AUC score on the Kaggle platform.

**Key techniques**: Graph representation, kernel methods (n-th order walk kernel, min-max kernel), SVM

### [QRT Data Challenge - Electricity Price Prediction](DataChallenge/)

Developed models to predict daily electricity price variations for futures contracts in France and Germany. Implemented various preprocessing techniques and feature engineering approaches to improve prediction accuracy.

**Key techniques**: Time series analysis, feature engineering, random forest regression, correlation analysis
